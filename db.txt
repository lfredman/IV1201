Tables:

availability: Contains availability records for people, with fields for availability_id, person_id, from_date, and to_date.
competence: Stores the competencies with competence_id and name (e.g., ticket sales, lotteries, roller coaster operation).
competence_profile: Associates people (person_id) with specific competencies (competence_id) and their years of experience.
person: Holds information about individuals, including person_id, name, surname, pnr, email, password, role_id, and username.
role: Contains roles (e.g., employee roles) with role_id and name.
Sequences:

Sequences have been created for availability_id, competence_id, competence_profile_id, person_id, and role_id to auto-generate primary keys for each table.
Data:

The availability table contains a list of records indicating when individuals are available. There are multiple records of availability spanning different dates.
The competence table holds three competencies: ticket sales, lotteries, and roller coaster operation.
The competence_profile table records the competencies of individuals and their respective years of experience.
The person table stores information about several individuals, some with email addresses and usernames, while others only have an id and password. The roles in this table are linked by role_id.
The role table links specific roles (such as staff) to the individuals in the person table.
In conclusion, this database structure focuses on managing people, their roles, their competencies, and their availability for specific tasks. The data shows relationships between people and their respective competencies as well as their availability over time.
